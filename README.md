This repository contains a list of common **content-type obfuscations** and **bypass techniques**, which are used to test upload parameters in web applications. The file includes various content types for images, documents, archives, and media files, as well as techniques to bypass content-type validation checks.

## Use Cases
- **Brute-forcing upload parameters** to check for content-type validation weaknesses.
- **Testing file upload functionality** for misconfigurations in web applications.
- **Exploring content-type bypass methods** to aid in security testing and vulnerability research.

## List of Bypass Techniques
The content-type list includes:
- Variations of image, document, archive, and media content types.
- Misspellings, case variations, and mixed content types to bypass restrictions.
- Fake or mixed content types for evading file validation logic.

## How to Use
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Use the list in security testing tools like **Burp Suite** or other web security tools for **content-type brute-forcing**.
3. Modify and expand the list based on your testing requirements.
